<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Originally, I wanted to go into research - more specifically into neuropsychology. But once I spontaneously joined a workshop at Epicodus, I've learned that I have a lot of fun coding and enjoy it's learning process. Outside of that though, I work on art projects, read, and play videogames from time to time. </p>
