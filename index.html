<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Originally, I wanted to go into research - more specifically into neuropsychology. But once I spontaneously joined a workshop at Epicodus, I've learned that I have a lot of fun coding and enjoy it's learning process. That being said, I am currently taking a gap year due to an unforseen circumstance and decided to learn how to program at Epicodus. Outside of that though, I work on art projects - more specifically oil/acrylic painting and sketching. I also like reading and playing videogames when given the time. </p>
